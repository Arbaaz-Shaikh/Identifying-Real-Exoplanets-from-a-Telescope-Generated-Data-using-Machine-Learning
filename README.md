# Identifying-Real-Exoplanets-from-a-Telescope-Generated-Data-using-Machine-Learning

This project’s goal is to take the data generated by Kepler Telescope as training data and use Planetary features to build a machine learning model which could predict potentially real exoplanet. Output of this project is to build machine learning model and predict real exoplanets from Kepler database.
Datasets are provided in each of the folders, and also the solution to the problem statements have been provided.
